# Weather-API-using-Python
This project collects global weather data and informs us about the weather of the place we are looking for.

 ## Python Modules used :
 ### Datetime
  - The datetime module supplies classes for manipulating dates and times.
  - While date and time arithmetic is supported, the focus of the implementation is on efficient attribute extraction for output formatting and manipulation.

   ### Installation of Datetime :
   To use datetime , you need to install it: 
 
              $ pip install DateTime
 
 ## OpenWeatherMap
  - OpenWeatherMap is an online service, owned by OpenWeather Ltd, that provides global weather data via API, including current weather data, forecasts, nowcasts and historical     weather data for any geographical location. 
  - The company provides a minute-by-minute hyperlocal precipitation forecast for any location
 
              
 ## Languages used :
 ### Python
  - Python is an interpreted, high-level and general-purpose programming language.
  - Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991.
  - Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace.
  - It is similar to English as the complications of writing the code is very less compared to other languages.
  - A 4 line printing code in Java can be done in 1 line in Python.
  - It can be used for other types of programming and software development besides web development
 ### Jupyter Notebook
  - The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text.
  - Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more.
